# 📚 Week 5 – Linked Lists & Dynamic Memory
### CS50x | Group Exercise Session

This repository contains **3 focused exercises** and one **mini assignment**,
based directly on the CS50x Week 5 source files.

All code in this repo comes from the official CS50 material (`list1.c` → `list6.c`).
Your job is to **read, understand, complete, and extend** it — together.

## 👥 How to Work in Groups

1. **Form Groups**
2. **Read before you write.** Before touching the keyboard, read the starter file aloud as a group and make sure everyone understands each line.
3. **Use the discussion questions** in `EXERCISES.md` — they are not optional. They are the most important part.
4. **Don't copy-paste solutions.** The `solutions/` folder is locked for students. The struggle is the point.
5. **Stuck for 10+ minutes?** Raise your hand — don't waste group time.

## 📝 Exercise Overview

| # | File | Concept | From PDF |
|---|------|---------|----------|
| 1 | `list1.c` | `malloc`, `realloc`, resize an array | list1.c |
| 2 | `list3.c` | Define a node struct, prepend to list | list3.c |
| 3 | `list6.c` | Traverse a list and free all memory | list6.c |

See **[EXERCISES.md](EXERCISES.md)** for full descriptions and tasks.

## 🏆 Mini Assignment – List Manager

After the exercises, your group will build a small **interactive list manager** that lets a user add numbers, print the list, and quit — using a linked list and proper memory management.

See the `assignment/list_manager/` folder for the starter code and requirements.
